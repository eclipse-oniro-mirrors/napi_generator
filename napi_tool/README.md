# napi_tool

## Introduction
NAPI framework for a code generation tool, according to the user interface file under the specified path of ts can generate a key for a framework code, business code framework and designed.the GN file, so developers need to focus on Nodejs related grammar framework layer, interface between c + + with JS type conversion, data type conversion, etc., can focus on business logic implementation, Thus, the development efficiency can be greatly improved. Currently, the tool supports command line and VScode plug-in.

### Function
#### Executable file development instructions
1.Install pkg :execute the command sudo npm i -g pkg

2.Package three versions : execute the command pkg vscode_plugin/gnapi/gen/cmd_gen.js

After performing the preceding steps，ou can generate Windows, Linux, and MAC executable programs in the Gen directory:cmd_gen-win.exe、cmd_gen-linux.

#### Plug-in development Instructions
1. Install yo : execute the command npm install -g yo generator-code.

2. Use yo : execute the command yo code，gnapi is a plug-in code framework generated by Yo Code, in which gnAPI/Gen directory is the source code of the automatic generation of NAPI program we developed.

3. Run npm i vsce in the napi_generator/vscode_plugin/gnapi directory.

4. Execute the command./node_modules/vsce/vsce package command，The final package generates a plugin, gnapI-0.0.1.vsix.

## Development process

1. Copy the Windows executable program cmd_gen-win.exe from the gen directory to the corresponding directory. You do not need to install the program.
2. Copy the Linux executable program cmd_gen-linux from the gen directory to the corresponding directory, and run it directly on the terminal.

### Usage

#### Windows

1) The.d.ts files to be converted should be placed in any directory. It is recommended to put them in the same directory as the executable program cmd_gen-win.exe, for example:

![](pic-en/pic-d-ts-location.png)

2) Right-click Windows Start menu, click Run, enter CMD, and click OK.

![](pic-en/pic-cmd.png)

3) In the command line interface (CLI), go to the directory where the previous executable program cmd_gen-win.exe resides and run cmd_gen-win.exe. After cmd_gen-win.exe, the corresponding.

4) After successful operation, the corresponding file will be generated in the directory where the. D. ts file says, for example:

![](pic-en/pic-d-ts-transition.png)

#### Linux

1) Put the.d.ts files to be converted in any directory. It is recommended to put them in the same directory as the executable program cmd_gen-linux, for example:

   ![](pic-en/pic-d-ts-location-linux.png)

2) In the terminal, go to the directory where the previous executable program cmd_gen-linux resides and run cmd_gen-linux. After cmd_gen-linux, the corresponding. D. s file name, for example:

   ![](pic-en/pic-cmd-execute-linux.png)

3) After successful operation, the corresponding file will be generated in the directory where the. D. ts file says, for example:

   ![](pic-en/pic-d-ts-transition-linux.png)

#### Mac

4) Find the.d.ts file to convert in vscode, for example:

   ![](pic-en/pic-plug-in-select-d-ts.png)

5) Right click on.d.ts and select.d.ts to generate c++ options.
